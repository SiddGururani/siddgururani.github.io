{"name":"Siddharth Kumar Gururani","tagline":"","body":"#Portfolio\r\n\r\nThis page consists of a list of some of my work in the field of Music Technology, specifically in Music Information Retrieval. Following that, there is a section containing music played by me on the guitar to demonstrate my ability.\r\n\r\n##Projects in Music Technology\r\n\r\n###Automatic Raga Classification\r\nMy Master's thesis at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, submitted towards completion of my dual degree in Computer Science. The thesis explores the use of Swara features for classification, thus making use of musicological aspects of Hindustani Ragas.\r\n\r\n###Feature Importance in Diurnal and Seasonal Classification of Hindustani Ragas\r\nThis was my initial topic of exploration for my master's thesis at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This project combines elements of Computational Musicology and MIR.\r\nA preliminary thesis report is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6PQjfvdhRv_S3NMQnlfZ1lXSVk/view?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n###Rhythm Extraction\r\nThis is a project I worked on during my summer internship at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the guidance of Professor Pascale Fung. \r\nA project report for this is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6PQjfvdhRv_aXhQb29NcmtraGM/view?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nThe work was carried out along with another summer intern, Arjun Rao. The workload was shared equally for the onset detection algorithm section of the project, following which Arjun took leave and I took the project forward.\r\n\r\nThe internship duration was 10 weeks.\r\n\r\n###Anomaly Detection\r\nThis was my second project running in tandem with my rhythm extraction project at HKUST. The purpose of this project was to act as supporting software for a commercial mobile application.\r\nA project report for this is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6PQjfvdhRv_YjUxc1E5NzE1Y0E/view?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n##Music\r\n\r\n###Covers\r\n####Opeth - Harvest\r\nThis song was one of the songs that inspired me to play the guitar. I played this song live with my group, and recently recorded the solo.\r\n\r\n###Improvisations\r\n####Melodic Improvisation in Em\r\n\r\n###Gear\r\nGuitars: Ibanez Prestige RG1527, Ibanez GSA60\r\nEffects: Line6 POD HD500, Peavey Revalver MKIII.V\r\nMonitors: Audio-technica ATH-M50\r\nInterface: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2\r\nDAW: Audacity, Reaper","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
